Writing therapy:
Writing therapy allows the person to organize their thoughts in writing. The written record of the person's objective accomplishments can enable the person to associate those accomplishments with reality, rather than simply dismissing the accomplishments internally. The written record can also remind the person of those accomplishments later. By these methods, writing therapy attempts to alleviate the person's sense of inadequacy.

Weiner’s (1985) attributional theory

For example, Lyden and her colleagues (2002) found that using a carefully structured feedback tech-
nique influenced the attributions individuals made concerning their performance, in so far as participants attributed
successful performance to ability (internal), and unsuccessful performance to lack of effort or other external attrib-
utes.

"Researchers  have  identified
a  number  of  factors  contributing  to  the
emergence    of    Impostorism,    including    perfectionism"
http://bsris.swu.ac.th/journal/i6/6-6_Jaruwan_73-92.pdf
"Clance (1985) suggested that the Impostor Phenomenon
is  marked  by  six  potential  characteristics:  (1)  The  Impostor  Cycle,  (2)  The need to be special or to be the very best, (3) Superman/Superwoman aspects;
(4) Fear of failure, (5) Denial of competence and Discounting praise, and (6)
Fear and guilt about success."
Minimum 2 characteristics to be imposter

Nice diagram on page 3
"Clanc
e (1985) has suggested that Impostors have high expectation
for their goals and have their own concept of ideal success.  Impostors disregard
their  success  if  there  is  any  gap  between  their  actual  performance
and  their
ideal  standard,  which  contributes  to
discounting  of  positive  feedback"
"Since
Impostors are high achievers who also “make unreasonably low assessments
of  their  performance”  (Want  &  Kleitman,  2006,  p.  969),  the  repetitions  of
success emphasise the discrepancy between their actual and ideal sta
ndards of
success as well as strengthening the feeling of being a fraud or an impostor."
"Predisposing    personality    traits,    such    as    neuroticism    and
perfectionism,  are  assumed  to  be  other  factors  which  contribute  to  the
emergence   of   Impostorism.   These   predisposing   personality   traits   are
assumed  to  be  stable  and  may  partly  contribute  to  the  format
ion  of  the
cognitive schema of a person. "

" Clance  (1985)
suggested  four  general  characteristics  of  the  family  that  contribute  to  the
perpetuation  of  the  Impostor  Phenomenon  from  many  of  her  patients‟
developmental histories: (1) the perception of Impostors that their talen
ts are
atypical  compared  with  family  members,  (2)  family  messages  that  convey
the  importance  of  intellectual  abilities  and  that  success  requires  little  effort,
(3)  discrepancy  between  feedback  about  Impostors‟  abilities  and  success
derived from family and
other sources, and (4) lack of positive reinforcement"

"With  a  sample  of  302  students,  Bussotti  found  that  CIPS  scores  were
negatively related to the Family Cohesion and Expressiveness subscales and
positively correlated with the Family Conflict and Family Control subscales
of  the  Family  E
nvironment  Scale.    These  four  subscales:  Family  Cohesion,
Family  Expressiveness,  Family  Conflict,  and  Family  Control,  accounted  for
12% of the variance in the CIPS scores "

"Sonnak  and  Towell  found  that
perceived   parental   control/overprotection   was   weakly   correlated   with
impostor fears, r = .27, while perceived parental care was inversely related, r
=
-
.41.  Sonnak  and  Towell  (2001)  concluded  that  pa
rental  overprotection
was a factor in development of impostor fears"

"Want  and  Kleitman  found  that  impostor  fears  were  weakly
correlated  with  high  levels  of  control  and  domination  by  both  mothers,  r  =
.25, an
d fathers, r = .34"

"Without  psychological  support  or  family  approval  of  the  child‟s
accomplishments,  the  child  may  feel  that  his  or  her  achievements  are
dismiss
ed,  unimpressive,  or  unimportant.    Feelings  of  shame,  humiliation,
and  inauthenticity  are  often  experienced  with  a  lack  of  consistent  positive
reinforcement"

"King   and   Cooley   (1995)   studied   the   r
elationship   between   family
achievement  orientation  and  the  development  of  impostor  fears  in  127
undergraduate  students.    A  weak  positive  relationship  between  impostor
fears   and   family   orientation   that   emphasised   achievement   value   and
competition  was  report
ed, r = .21."

"  In
addition,  confusing  messages  about  achievement  from  the  family  appeared
more  strongly  related  to  Imp
ostorism  than  family  achievement  values  that
emphasised achievement via competition.  "

  (2005)
  asserted  that  perfectionism  is  the  underlying  cau
  se  of  Neurotic  Imposture.
  Impostors set “excessively high, unrealistic goals and then experience self
  -
  defeating thoughts and behaviors when they can‟t reach those goals” (Kets
  de  Vries,  2005,  p.  112)"

" These  results  mean  Impostors  had  the  need  to
appear  to  be  capable,  competent  and  successful  in  order  to  gain  respect  and
admiration  from  others.    They  also  strived  to  conceal  their  imperfection  by
not  engaging  in  situations  when  they  were  likely  to  rev
eal  their  personal
limitations  to  others. "

"Impost
ors  will  openly
communicate   their   self
-
perception   of   imperfect   performance   to   others
(Ferrari & Thompson, 2006).  Impostors do not want to appear imperfect and
actively  attempt  to  conceal  their  imperfection,  but  paradoxically  Impostors
do  openly  disclose  t
heir  imperfection  to  others.    One  issue  is  how  far  the
characteristics of Impostors are interpersonal strategies, avoiding attributions
by others, as distinct from more concerned with their own self evaluation."

" behaviours  of
Impostors  can  be  viewed  as  self
-
presentational  strategies  used  to  avoid
negative  interpersonal  implications  of  potential  failure  by  engaging  in  self
-
deprecating behaviours,  such as discounting praise and positive feedback or
denyi
ng  that  they  are  as  competent  as  others  believe"
"Impostors  expressed  lower  performance  expectations  than  non
-
Impostors  only  when  their  performance  would  be  revealed  to  others,  while
Ferrari  and  Thompson  (2006)  found  CIPS  sc
ores  were  positively  correlated
with favourable impression management strategies."

THE  IMPOSTOR  PHENOMENON:
RECENT  RESEARCH  FINDINGS  REGARDING
DYNAMICS,  PERSONALITY  AND  FAMILY  PATTERNS
AND  THEIR  IMPLICATIONS  FOR  TREATMENT:

" Impostors also described mem-
selves  as  holding,  to  a  high  degree,  a  view  of
intelligence as a fixed entity rather than as a mal-
leable quality"
when failed..."There was a strong posi-
tive correlation between
 a pattern
  of helpless reac-
  tions  and  impostor  feelings  as  measured  by  the
  Clance  IP Scale"
  "d entity tend
  to be
   motivated by "performance
    goals,"
     in which
     one  is  motivated  primarily  by  the  wish  to  prove
     one's  intelligence.  Dweck  has  found  that,  when
     people  with  performance  goals  experience  mis-
     takes or failure,  they tend to react in a "helpless"
     behavioral  pattern  in  which  they  withdraw  from
     the  task,  blame  themselves  for  the  failure,  and
     experience  anxiety  and  shame. "
     "motivated by the need to look  smart to others and
     are shaped by an overriding concern with others'
     impressions"
     "self-worth  seems to be unusually depen-
     dent on others'  feedback."
     "ly  in  trying  to
     live up to an idealized self-image of being intelli-
     gent  in  order  to  get  the  validation  necessary  to
     feel  good  about themselves.  As  long  as  admira-
     tion  from  others is  present,  they  may  maintain a
     feeling of
      worth,
       but when others are not validat-
       ing  them,  their  good  self-feeling  may  plummet
       since  it is  based  on  external  feedback."

       " Impostor
       phenomenon  scores  were  negatively  correlated
       with  the Cohesion  subscale,  which  measures  the
       degree  of  support  family  members  provide  one
       another,  and the Expressiveness  subscale,  which
       measures  the  degree  to  which  family  members
       are  allowed  to  be  open  with  their  feelings"
       "The
       impostor  experience   was  positively   correlated
       with  the  Conflict  subscale,  which  assesses  the
       amount  of  expressed  anger  and  conflict  in  the
       family,
        and
         the Control subscale, which measures
         the degree to which rules
          and
           procedures
            are
             used
             to govern family  behaviors.  "
             "Together,  these  four
             scales  accounted  for  12% of  the  variance  in im-
             postor phenomenon  scores,  giving  evidence  that
             people   who  experience   impostor   feelings   are
             likely  to  come  from  families  in  which  support
             for
              the
               individual is lacking, communications and
               behaviors,
                are
                  controlled  by  rules,  and  consider-
                  able conflict  is  present."

"t was found  that impostor
feelings  were  highly  correlated  with  a  need  to
please  others in the  family."
" the impostor phenomenon was
positively correlated with
 a
  high degree of "defen-
  dence,"  indicating  a  mistrustful,   self-protective
  attitude  toward  others,  and,  in  women  subjects,
  a   low   degree   of   "affiliation,"   an   enjoyable
  involvement  with  other  people,   and  "play,"  a
  tendency to do things for
   fun.
   "

   "For females,  impostor,  feelings
   had  low  correlations  with  impulsivity  and  need
   for change,  consistent  with  the  usual  description
   of  impostors  as  cautious  and  unlikely  to  engage
   in risk-taking.  For males,  on the other hand, im-
   postor feelings  were  associated  with high impul-
   sivity  and a strong need  for change,  as well  as a
   low need for
    order."

" Beard (1990) speculated that,
instead of dealing with their sense of  inadequacy
in the
 withdrawing style typical of females impos-
 tors,
   male  impostors  may  tend to compensate by
   pushing themselves in a frenetic  manner in order
   to prove their competency. "


"Beard speculated that
the  primacy  of  relationships  in  females'  value systems
 might
  prevent
   them
    from
     putting
       relation-
       ships  at risk by  taking  the  kinds of  chances that
       males  might  take  in  order  to  prove  themselves
       through achievements."

       "lthough people who exhibit impostor feel-
       ings do not seem to  suffer  from  generalized  low
       self-esteem,  their self-esteem,  at least in the area
       of achievement, is precarious, requiring a system
       of defenses  that is taxing  and anxiety-producing"

"Impostors  are  motivated  to  achieve  primarily  to
"look  smart," reflected in  a  strong  focus  on the
self  during  achievement  attempts  and a  concern
for  what  their  performance  indicates  to  others
about  their  abilities."

"When  validation
  of  the
    self
      is
      lacking,
       as
        appears
         to be the
          case
           in the
            families
            of those who develop impostor feelings,
             the
              child
              may compensate
               by
                trying
                 to
                  live
                   up to an
                    ideal-
                    ized image that will win the affirmation  from oth-
                    ers  that
                      is
                        necessary
                          for
                            self-esteem.
                             "

"The central task
 of
  psychotherapy  with impos-
  tors is to lessen the client's dependence on others'
  positive evaluations
   for
    his
     or
      her self-esteem  and
      to build
        a
         more  internalized  sense
           of
             serf-worth"

           How can therapist help?  "  a
               warm  acceptance
                 of  all
                   aspects
                     of the
                     person, an empathic understanding of the person's
                     internal  world,
                       and  an
                         attitude
                           in  the
                             therapist
                             of  genuineness
                               and
                                 emotional  honesty"

The phenomenology of  the impostor
phenomenon:

"impostors
reported low self-appraisals as well as low reflected appraisals, indicating an overall lack
of positive regard for the self rather than the discrepancy predicted by the theory"

"people with high scores on impostor scales
reported they would do poorly on an upcoming intelligence test, but only when they
thought their responses would be public"

"In a private response condition, they did not
predict failure."
"These findings were bolstered by McElwee and Yurak (2007) who found
that impostor scales correlated significantly with other measures of self-presentation"
"The
data supported the notion of impostor scales measuring a self-deprecating self-
presentation strategy akin to self-handicapping"
"general negative affect and self-deprecating self-presentation than to
actual impostor feelings."
"nstead of conceptualizing the IP as a stable
personality trait that people have to varying degrees, we argue that it is better
conceptualized as an aversive affective state that can affect many people in certain
situations"
"Although common sense suggests people want to be viewed
favorably, self-verification research shows this to be true only for people who view
themselves favorably. People with negative self-concepts prefer interaction and
relationship partners who confirm their negative self-views, or they feel uncomfortable
and reject the positive feedback"
Motivating for future improvement: “It made me want to work harder so that the next time I get a compliment, I
would know I deserved it”"
