Writing therapy:
Writing therapy allows the person to organize their thoughts in writing. The written record of the person's objective accomplishments can enable the person to associate those accomplishments with reality, rather than simply dismissing the accomplishments internally. The written record can also remind the person of those accomplishments later. By these methods, writing therapy attempts to alleviate the person's sense of inadequacy.

Weiner’s (1985) attributional theory

For example, Lyden and her colleagues (2002) found that using a carefully structured feedback tech-
nique influenced the attributions individuals made concerning their performance, in so far as participants attributed
successful performance to ability (internal), and unsuccessful performance to lack of effort or other external attrib-
utes.

THE  IMPOSTOR  PHENOMENON:
RECENT  RESEARCH  FINDINGS  REGARDING
DYNAMICS,  PERSONALITY  AND  FAMILY  PATTERNS
AND  THEIR  IMPLICATIONS  FOR  TREATMENT:

" Impostors also described mem-
selves  as  holding,  to  a  high  degree,  a  view  of
intelligence as a fixed entity rather than as a mal-
leable quality"
when failed..."There was a strong posi-
tive correlation between
 a pattern
  of helpless reac-
  tions  and  impostor  feelings  as  measured  by  the
  Clance  IP Scale"
  "d entity tend
  to be
   motivated by "performance
    goals,"
     in which
     one  is  motivated  primarily  by  the  wish  to  prove
     one's  intelligence.  Dweck  has  found  that,  when
     people  with  performance  goals  experience  mis-
     takes or failure,  they tend to react in a "helpless"
     behavioral  pattern  in  which  they  withdraw  from
     the  task,  blame  themselves  for  the  failure,  and
     experience  anxiety  and  shame. "
     "motivated by the need to look  smart to others and
     are shaped by an overriding concern with others'
     impressions"
     "self-worth  seems to be unusually depen-
     dent on others'  feedback."
     "ly  in  trying  to
     live up to an idealized self-image of being intelli-
     gent  in  order  to  get  the  validation  necessary  to
     feel  good  about themselves.  As  long  as  admira-
     tion  from  others is  present,  they  may  maintain a
     feeling of
      worth,
       but when others are not validat-
       ing  them,  their  good  self-feeling  may  plummet
       since  it is  based  on  external  feedback."

       " Impostor
       phenomenon  scores  were  negatively  correlated
       with  the Cohesion  subscale,  which  measures  the
       degree  of  support  family  members  provide  one
       another,  and the Expressiveness  subscale,  which
       measures  the  degree  to  which  family  members
       are  allowed  to  be  open  with  their  feelings"
       "The
       impostor  experience   was  positively   correlated
       with  the  Conflict  subscale,  which  assesses  the
       amount  of  expressed  anger  and  conflict  in  the
       family,
        and
         the Control subscale, which measures
         the degree to which rules
          and
           procedures
            are
             used
             to govern family  behaviors.  "
             "Together,  these  four
             scales  accounted  for  12% of  the  variance  in im-
             postor phenomenon  scores,  giving  evidence  that
             people   who  experience   impostor   feelings   are
             likely  to  come  from  families  in  which  support
             for
              the
               individual is lacking, communications and
               behaviors,
                are
                  controlled  by  rules,  and  consider-
                  able conflict  is  present."

"t was found  that impostor
feelings  were  highly  correlated  with  a  need  to
please  others in the  family."
" the impostor phenomenon was
positively correlated with
 a
  high degree of "defen-
  dence,"  indicating  a  mistrustful,   self-protective
  attitude  toward  others,  and,  in  women  subjects,
  a   low   degree   of   "affiliation,"   an   enjoyable
  involvement  with  other  people,   and  "play,"  a
  tendency to do things for
   fun.
   "

   "For females,  impostor,  feelings
   had  low  correlations  with  impulsivity  and  need
   for change,  consistent  with  the  usual  description
   of  impostors  as  cautious  and  unlikely  to  engage
   in risk-taking.  For males,  on the other hand, im-
   postor feelings  were  associated  with high impul-
   sivity  and a strong need  for change,  as well  as a
   low need for
    order."

" Beard (1990) speculated that,
instead of dealing with their sense of  inadequacy
in the
 withdrawing style typical of females impos-
 tors,
   male  impostors  may  tend to compensate by
   pushing themselves in a frenetic  manner in order
   to prove their competency. "


"Beard speculated that
the  primacy  of  relationships  in  females'  value systems
 might
  prevent
   them
    from
     putting
       relation-
       ships  at risk by  taking  the  kinds of  chances that
       males  might  take  in  order  to  prove  themselves
       through achievements."

       "lthough people who exhibit impostor feel-
       ings do not seem to  suffer  from  generalized  low
       self-esteem,  their self-esteem,  at least in the area
       of achievement, is precarious, requiring a system
       of defenses  that is taxing  and anxiety-producing"

"Impostors  are  motivated  to  achieve  primarily  to
"look  smart," reflected in  a  strong  focus  on the
self  during  achievement  attempts  and a  concern
for  what  their  performance  indicates  to  others
about  their  abilities."

"When  validation
  of  the
    self
      is
      lacking,
       as
        appears
         to be the
          case
           in the
            families
            of those who develop impostor feelings,
             the
              child
              may compensate
               by
                trying
                 to
                  live
                   up to an
                    ideal-
                    ized image that will win the affirmation  from oth-
                    ers  that
                      is
                        necessary
                          for
                            self-esteem.
                             "

"The central task
 of
  psychotherapy  with impos-
  tors is to lessen the client's dependence on others'
  positive evaluations
   for
    his
     or
      her self-esteem  and
      to build
        a
         more  internalized  sense
           of
             serf-worth"

           How can therapist help?  "  a
               warm  acceptance
                 of  all
                   aspects
                     of the
                     person, an empathic understanding of the person's
                     internal  world,
                       and  an
                         attitude
                           in  the
                             therapist
                             of  genuineness
                               and
                                 emotional  honesty"

The phenomenology of  the impostor
phenomenon:

"impostors
reported low self-appraisals as well as low reflected appraisals, indicating an overall lack
of positive regard for the self rather than the discrepancy predicted by the theory"

"people with high scores on impostor scales
reported they would do poorly on an upcoming intelligence test, but only when they
thought their responses would be public"

"In a private response condition, they did not
predict failure."
"These findings were bolstered by McElwee and Yurak (2007) who found
that impostor scales correlated significantly with other measures of self-presentation"
"The
data supported the notion of impostor scales measuring a self-deprecating self-
presentation strategy akin to self-handicapping"
"general negative affect and self-deprecating self-presentation than to
actual impostor feelings."
"nstead of conceptualizing the IP as a stable
personality trait that people have to varying degrees, we argue that it is better
conceptualized as an aversive affective state that can affect many people in certain
situations"
"Although common sense suggests people want to be viewed
favorably, self-verification research shows this to be true only for people who view
themselves favorably. People with negative self-concepts prefer interaction and
relationship partners who confirm their negative self-views, or they feel uncomfortable
and reject the positive feedback"
Motivating for future improvement: “It made me want to work harder so that the next time I get a compliment, I
would know I deserved it”"
